        <h2>  About Busan </h2> 

        <div class = "contents">Busan is the second largest city in Korea, next to Seoul. Approximately 1 hour outside of Daegu , Busan is dubbed Korea’s San Francisco, for the fact, it’s got the largest port. Thus, it’s home to raw fish markets, bridges, beaches and adorned with clustered hillside neighborhoods.
            Busan is not an intuitive or easy city to travel if you’re short on time. It’s a large, sprawled out city and subway lines don’t always offer door-to-door service to popular tourist attractions.</div>


        <br><br>

        <h2> Where to Stay in Busan </h2>
        <div class = "contents">Busan is such a large city, you won’t find yourself at a loss of options for places to stay within your price range. The main question to ask is where? From hostels, to  love motels, budget hotels and luxury hotels, Busan has it all.
            <br> &nbsp;<strong>Park Hyatt Busan </strong> Deep wood tones and marble, Park Hyatt Busan is one of the best hotels of Busan. A view of the ocean and Gwangan Bridge make it a romantic escape.  This is for the traveler who wants to do Busan in style.
            <br>&nbsp;<strong>Tokyo Inn </strong> Under $50/night moderate hotel is Toyoko Inn (near Busan Station). Decent price to stay in Busan.
            <br> &nbsp;<strong>Lion Hotel </strong> Budget friendly yet elegance. Simple and clean place to stay.

            <br><br>
        <h2> What to do and see in Busan </h2>
        <div class="tit">1. Take the Busan City Bus Tour </div>
        <div class="contents1">Located right outside the Busan KTX station is the Busan City Bus Tour set up by the city of Busan.   It’s a quick, easy, cheap and wonderful way to get an overview of the city highlights as well as, door-to-door access to some of the obvious attractions. The tour offers two courses:  a Haeundae Beach route and a Taejongdae route . You can transfer from one course to another. Admission gains you entry aboard a double-decker bus and discount on admission to participating museums, memorials, etc…  <br>Admission: 10,000W Adults;  8,000W for KTX ticket holding passengers. </div>

             <br><br>
        <div class="tit">2. Jalgachi Fish Market </div>
        <div class="contents1">If there’s a photogenic grit or raw edge to traveling Busan, the wharf area of Jalgachi Fish Market hits a memorable note. Keyword- rubber boots! (You’ll see a lot of them here)   Ajummas (meaning middle-aged or married woman in Korean) and ajosshis (“uncles”) are this fish market’s working population and you’ll see fish in a way you’ve never seen them before.  Whether dried and hanging, toothpick splayed, skinned or live, I’m convinced there’s an art and pride to the fishes on display. You can check out the daily catch and then have the seller cook it up for you inside.   Just make sure you don’t get splattered on. <br>Hours: 8am to 10pm daily, arrive at 5a to see vendors set up their stalls.</div>
            <br><br>
        <div class="tit">3. Gukje Market & Bupyeong Market</div>
        <div class="contents1">Next door to PIFF is Busan’s largest traditional market, Gukje Market. Originating from the 1950 Korean War, Gukje Market was once a market for commerce of U.S. military supplies and foreign goods. Today it is stocked with household appliances, clothing and homeware products at inexpensive prices. It also houses Gukje Food Market, where you can snack on Korean street food bites like tteokbokki (spicy rice dumplings), hotteok (sweet pancake crackers), dried seafood and more. Next door is Bupyeong Market, also known as kkantong (meaning “cans” in Korean) market. It used to be known for selling canned products but now sells domestic to imported products and Korean snacks. 
            <br><br> &nbsp; Note: Cash mostly.
            <br> &nbsp; Hours: 9a.m.-8p.m. Gukje Market address: Sinchang-dong 4-ga, Jung-gu, Busan</div>
            <br><br>
        <div class="tit">4. Haeundae Beach</div>
        <div class="contents1">On a nice day, Haeundae Beach strikes a nice balance of casual beach chillaxing and people-watching. Young couples stroll the boardwalk fashioning trendy outfits from the Korean version of couples’ Vogue – heels, man-purses and sports coats- which make you think Boys Before Flowers (a popular K-drama). It’s very Seoul,  but ala beach. All around, you see family beach picnics, frisbee playing and beach volleyball. Nearby is the Busan Aquarium for added recreation and a tourist information office for help. The few chic hotels which line the main boardwalk turn into the nightlife hotspots of the area. It’s not a very big area but it adds a small glitz to an otherwise dark and quiet town.
            <br><br> &nbsp; Getting There: Take the metro to Haeundae Beach station (Line 2, Green Line). The walk to the beach will take you about 10 minutes. </div>
