        <h2>  About Jeju Island </h2> 

        <div class = "contents">Known as the Korean Hawaii, Jeju attracts an interesting mix of  drop-dead gorgeous island beauty, a laidback vibe different from mainland Korea,  a more seaside flavor and lots of Korean honeymooners. Jeju City is the most cosmopolitan you’ll get when it comes to restaurants and stores and frankly, I didn’t spend much time here, other than to catch the bus.  I wanted to see the more exotic side of Korea, the one you might see on Korean dramas of a private getaway… not a climbing city.</div>


        <br><br>

        <h2> Where to Stay in Jeju </h2>
        <div class = "contents">Being the honeymoon capital of Korea, you’ll likely find some of the best hotels of Korea on this island. While you can stay near the airport or on the northern side of Jeju Island, such as Jeju City, the two most popular base camps for tourists are south of the island in Seogwipo and Jungmun. The southern part of the island seems to hold the best attractions.
            <br> &nbsp;<strong>Seogwipo </strong> falls second as one of the tourist destinations, but has less variety. Seogwipo is at the south eastern base of Jeju and the last stop on the Jeju Airport Shuttle bus.  There is a bus station in the city and that connects you to a lot of places you’ll want to see. Restaurants will be mostly Korean and much seafood.
            <br>&nbsp;<strong>Jungmun </strong> is the resort area and it’s got the best and most luxurious hotels on the island. Even if you don’t stay there, it’s worthwhile to see the backlots of some of these exaggeratedly posh hotels. Not only are some hotels shooting locations of K-dramas, but they also offer a unique look at luxury Korea.  Many hotels line the cliff overlooking the ocean.</div>


        <br><br><br><br>        
            <div class = "contents">City Bus, bike, taxi, scooter and car rentals are the transportation options to look around Jeju. </div>

        <br><br>
        <h2> Car rentals</h2>
            <div class = "contents">
                For Americans, driving in Korea can be a mental switch as Koreans drive on the left side of the road. In mainland Korea, Koreans are known to speed but on Jeju Island, driving can feel laid back with minimal lane choices and freeways.  For the most part, there is one main road that goes around the island and then a couple of roads cutting through it North to South. Bring your International Driver’s Permit and Driver’s License from home. <br>
                <strong> &nbsp; Scooters</strong>  Traffic is laid back enough for travelers to ride scooters but you still have to be cautious around blind corners. In order to rent a scooter you need to bring your International Driver’s Permit and Driver’s License from home.  Read Riding a Scooter around Udo Island
        </div>

        <br><br>
        <h2> Bus </h2>
            <div class = "contents">The bus routes are simple to spot on the map but you’ll still need occasional help with knowing which number to catch or where the bus stops are from your hotel.  The bus is efficient, cheap and will give you a nice ride around the island.  For Olle Trails, there’s English translation announcements, which let you know when to get off. Usually, there will be some type of English announcement made either by a computer generated announcement or on the electrical banner inside. If ever in doubt, sit close to the front of the bus near the bus driver and let him know where you’re going. He’ll be sure to let you know where your stop is if he knows you’re a tourist.</div>

        <br><br>
        <h2> Airport Shuttle Bus to Jungmun Resort or Seogwipo </h2>
            <div class = "contents">There is an airport shuttle bus or circle bus located outside Jeju Airport. It will drop you at various locations in Jeju City, Jungmun and lastly, Seogwipo. It’s under 8,000 Won. The bus is a coach bus with AC and comfortable seats.</div>

        <br><br>
        <h2> Jeju Trip Planning: How long should you stay? </h2>
            <div class = "contents">I’d say three or four days at the least. A week is good as it provides more coverage of the island and its activities. Then it depends on what you’d like to see. <br>
                &nbsp; Jeju has a lot of zany and unusual museums and theme parks.  For those more active, you can golf, hike to the top of Mount Halla (it will take a day) or walk Olle Trails ( 2 or 3 a day depending on ambition). <br>
                &nbsp; Udo Island can be visited in a day trip or you can spend a night there if you miss the ferry.  Lastly, if you’re there to visit the beach or take a leisurely drive around the island, the week+ duration is more for you. </div>
