        <h1> Seoul as the Main Character of Novels </h1>
   

            <div class="intro">In commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Korean War and 60th anniversary of the April Revolution, the special exhibition, Seoul as the Main Character of Novels, takes an intimate look at the city of Seoul and its people during the period following independence from Japan, up through the April Revolution, through various works of literature. As many as 500 works will be on display, including Park Wan-seo's 『The Thirsty Season』 and 『The Naked Tree』, Cho Ji-hun's 『Stand Before History』, and Park Tae-sun's 『The Collapsed Theater』. The exhibition provides the priceless opportunity to peak inside the pages of history to better understand the lives at the time of independence and the Korean War, as well as the very real anecdotes of those struggling to survive.
