        <h2>  Student Visa (D-2) </h2> 

        <div class = "contents">* The contents below are applicable to the undergraduates applying for student visa (D-2) only. 
            <br> &nbsp; For graduate students, please refer to ‘Visa & Immigration Guide for Graduate Students’. <br><br>&nbsp;
                All degree-seeking international students must obtain a student visa (D-2) before the beginning of the semester at Korea University. Other types of visa that permit international students to be enrolled in a degree-seeking program at a university in Korea (ex. F-type, E-type, A-type, etc.) are acceptable as well. However, short-term visas such as B-type or C-type visas are not acceptable as these visas do not allow foreigners to take academic programs at a university in Korea.
                
               <br><br>&nbsp; Student visa (D-2) can be acquired at a Korean embassy or consulate in the applicant’s home country. 

                The application for student visa (D-2) requires a number of documents like the Certificate of Admission (CoA), which will be issued by the International Education Team at Korea University. Proof of Final Academic Credentials and Financial Statement (ex. bank account, scholarship, etc.) which serves as proof of student’s budget for expenses while staying in Korea are needed too. Keep in mind that these documents may take a long time to be issued, and additional requirements may be asked of you during the process. Hence, it is recommended that students contact the Korean embassy or consulate in their residing country well ahead of time, to ask for the documents needed for student visa (D-2) application, and prepare them in advance to get the visa on time. 

                <br><br>&nbsp;After the application is approved, the Korean embassy or consulate will issue a D-2-2 (for undergraduate students) visa under the name of Korea University. If your visa is incorrectly issued (like D-2-1, D-2-3, etc.), please contact the embassy and correct your visa type. 

                For freshmen who may be already in Korea with a student visa (D-2) issued with the Certificate of Admission (CoA) from another university, it is mandatory for you to make a departure and apply for a new student visa (D-2) with the Certificate of Admission (CoA) issued from Korea University at the Korean embassy or consulate in your home country. 

                The general requirements for student visa (D-2) application are the following:
        </div>
                    <img src ="visa1.PNG" width="500" height="700" class="pickorea">  <br><br>




        <br><br>  <br><br>

       
        <div class = "contents">All international students are strongly advised and instructed to obtain a student visa (D-2) at the Korean embassy or consulate in their home countries. 
            However, if they are already in Korea without a student visa (D-2), they need to apply for the visa as soon as possible upon arrival. 
            They must apply for a student visa (D-2) and an Alien Registration Card (ARC) together at once at Sejongno Immigration Office. 
            The students must visit the immigration website (HiKorea) and make an online reservation for the visit to Sejongno Immigration Office. 
            Late application after the beginning of the semester may lead to a fine, and it is extremely difficult to visit Sejongno Immigration Office after the classes start. 
            Again, it is better to avoid entering Korea with a visa different from a student visa (D-2). 
            The students must try to get a student visa (D-2) at a Korean consulate or embassy in their home countries. 
        </div>


        <br><br>
            <div class = "c1"> *C-type visas, such as Group Tourism (C-3-2), Medical Tourism (C-3-3), 
                General Tourism (C-3-9), and Industrial Training (D-3), Non-Professional Employment (E-9), Vessel Crew (E-10), or Miscellaneous (G-1) visas CANNOT Be changed to a student visa (D-2) 
                after entering Korea. If the student is in Korea with one of the listed visas, he/she must leave Korea as soon as possible and apply for an appropriate visa in his/her home country.  </div>
